# Pricing Component with Toggle page

This front-end coding challenge was taken from https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pricing-component-with-toggle-8vPwRMIC.

Completed project deployed here https://pricing-cmpnt.netlify.app/

### The Challenge

Within this repo, I have created a pricing component, which displays price for each tier in an annual or monthly price. Project was built using Vue.js framework. A mixture of SCSS and HTML was used to style the page as close to the designs as possible, and Javascript was used to achieve the functionality of the website.

### What it does

You should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle to display different prices based on Annual and Monthly price
